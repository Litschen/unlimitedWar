# unlimtedWar - Project for PSIT1/2 ZHAW
# What is this:
A Risk-clone implemented using java and jsp. (not our choice was a requirement)

# Who did this:
Manuel Schreier, T, Crnjac, M. Huguenin => Group 02

# Why did you do this:
We had to do a self chosen project for the course PSIT1 and 2.

# How long did this take:
It took as three one semester of coding, it the first project for some members.

# What could be improved:
- Security sql credentials are set in code and thus public
    - put this into a config file
- Make Error messages more uniform
- Nicer event display
- Events for more things
- make it clearer what the "AI" did during its turn
- add missing testcases

# Final Words:
I know this project has a lot of room for improvment, i just wanted to privatly archive it in its final state after the project was done. Probably will never do anything on this.
